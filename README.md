# TensorFlow Report
## Introduction
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

Companies like Airbnb, china Mobile, Coca Cola, GE Healthcare, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Paypal, Twitter, WPS Office and so on are using TensorFlow to optimize their products.

Developed and maintained by Google Brain, Google's artificial intelligence team, TensorFlow has multiple projects including TensorFlow Hub, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow Research Cloud, as well as various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Since 2015 from November 9th, TensorFlow became an open source under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models, and to easily deploy in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use. Currently it supports C, Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go, and Swift. Other support language including C#, Haskell, Julia, Ruby, Rust, and Scala are still under development.

## Analysis of results
### pros
### cons

## Recommendations
First of all, TensorFlow helps us easily build models. Users can build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging. Whether users are beginners or experts, they all can find proper tutorials on the official TensorFlow web and self-learn the techniques.

Secondly, TensorFlow can be used for robust ML production anywhere. Users can easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language they use. 

Moreover, TensorFlow offers powerful experimentation for research. Via a simple and flexible architecture, users are able to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.
