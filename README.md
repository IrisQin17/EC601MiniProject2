# TensorFlow Report
## Introduction
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

Companies like Airbnb, china Mobile, Coca Cola, GE Healthcare, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Paypal, Twitter, WPS Office and so on are using TensorFlow to optimize their products.

Developed and maintained by Google Brain, Google's artificial intelligence team, TensorFlow has multiple projects including TensorFlow Hub, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow Research Cloud, as well as various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Since 2015 From November 9th, TensorFlow is open source under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python, JavaScript, or Swift, and to easily deploy in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use. Currently it supports C, Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go, and Swift. Other language including C#, Haskell, Julia, Ruby, Rust, and Scala are still under development.
